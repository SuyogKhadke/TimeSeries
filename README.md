# TimeSeries
As part of my final project for this course, I've begun working on a time series project. At this point, I've selected two datasets, one seasonal and one non-seasonal, with the aim of showcasing the knowledge I've gained throughout the course. I plan to apply what I've learned to these datasets in order to demonstrate my understanding.
